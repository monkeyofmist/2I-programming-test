In a language of your choice, using all best practice principles you’re aware of, 
could you please provide code that iterates in multiples of A until X, 
then in multiples of A + 1 until 2X, 
then multiples of A + 2 until 3X. 
Please state any assumptions you’ve made.

I assumed that the numbers would be integers and that the user would input these.
